Get your graphics "on the move" with this Animation library that uses CircuitPython's displayio to make buttery-smooth animations for your LCD/TFT display or LED matrix.



Usage
=====

This library consists of a `Animation` class.  `Here is an example showing how to use these Animations <https://github.com/kmatch98/CircuitPython_DisplayIO_Animation/tree/main/examples>`_


`Go check out the documentation with more details how to use these animation tools with displayio <https://circuitpython-displayio-animation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html>`_



Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_
* `Adafruit_DisplayIO_Layout <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_DisplayIO_Layout/>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://circuitpython.org/libraries>`_
or individual libraries can be installed using
`circup <https://github.com/adafruit/circup>`_.

Usage Example
=============

See scripts in the examples directory of this repository.
